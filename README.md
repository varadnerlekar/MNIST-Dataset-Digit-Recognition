# Handwritten Digit Recognition of MNIST Dataset using CNN

The MNIST database of handwritten digits has a training set of 60000 examples, and a test set of 10000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image i.e 28x28 pixels for easier model training.
